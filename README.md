# Neural-Network-with-Tensorflow-for-Regression
In this notebook, I am going to build multiple neural network models to solve a regression problem. I would like to give a brief overview of what I will touch on and what steps I will follow. I will build a neural network model and then improve it in order to achieve better predictions, also will show this development visually in the graphs. As I mentioned above, I am going to solve a regression problem by building a neural network model. There are multiple definitions for a regression problem, but in this case, I am going to simplify it as predicting a number. Generally this notebook involves:
* Importing important libraries
* Creating data set
* Checking input and output shapes
* Visualizing data
* Building a neural network model
* Checking predictions
* Evaluating the model
* Visualizing predictions
* Checking different combinations of parameters for finding better predictions
* Creating a dataframe of model's predictions

In conclusion, I have builded 6 model totally, and managed to build a model with almost best predictions.
